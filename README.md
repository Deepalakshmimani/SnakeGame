# Snake Game 🐍

This is a simple **Snake Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game allows the player to control the snake, eat food, grow in length, and avoid hitting the walls. The game also includes a **pause** and **resume** feature using the spacebar.

## Features

- Move the snake using **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →)  
- Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score  
- Pause and resume the game using the **spacebar**  
- Game‑over detection when the snake hits the walls  
- Simple and responsive design

2. Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake's direction.  
3. Eat the red food blocks to increase your score and grow longer.  
4. Avoid hitting the walls; running into the boundary ends the game.  
5. Press the **spacebar** again if you want to pause the game.
